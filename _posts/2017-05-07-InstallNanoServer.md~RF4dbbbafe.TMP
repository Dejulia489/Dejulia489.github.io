title: How to Install Nano Server

Nano Server is a stripped-down version of Windows Server developed by Microsoft specifically for running cloud applications and containers. There is no local logon or Remote Desktop. Instead, management of the OS is performed remotely via WMI and PowerShell cmdlets.

Let's use some commands we learned in an [earlier post](https://dejulia489.github.io/2017-05-06-CreateHyperVVM/) to create a new VM in Hyper V.

###### We can use the snippet below to create a new VM. 

	New-VM -Name NanoServer1 -VHDPath 'C:\Windows Server 2016 DataCenter Nano VHD\NanoServerDataCenter.vhd' -Path 'C:\VirtualMachines' 

###### We can use the snippet below to configure the network adapter. 

	Get-VM -VMName NanoServer1 | 
		Get-VMNetworkAdapter | 
		Connect-VMNetworkAdapter -SwitchName 'VirtualSwitch1' 

###### Let's start our server
