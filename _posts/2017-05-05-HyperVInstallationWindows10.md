Before we can enjoy our home movie content from anywhere we will need a server to host it. We are going to use Microsoft Hyper V because its free and its more than capable of task.

```Powershell
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

{% highlight Powershell linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
