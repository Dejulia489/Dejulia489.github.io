# Installing OpenSSH

In two of my earlier posts we [created a Linux VM](https://dejulia489.github.io/2017-05-06-CreateLinuxVirtualServerHyperV/) and [installed Powershell on Linux](https://dejulia489.github.io/2017-05-06-InstallingPowershellOnLinux/), now let's install [OpenSSH](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/openssh-server.html) and start remoting. OpenSSH is a freely available version of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol family of tools for remotely controlling, or transferring files between, computers. 

###### We can use the snippet below to install OpenSSH in the terminal

Coming Soon...
